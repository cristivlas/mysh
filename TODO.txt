implement a simple command for reading user input

cp perf: add argument to cp to specify buffer size; multi-threaded cp? cp rollback?

job control? (do I care?)

more tests

Consistent symlink support across all commands; support symbolic links in TAB auto-complete in Windows.

Deleting symlinks works from the WSL side, but not from Windows. Creating links from Windows requires elevation, works with `sudo`, but the UAC spawning a new console window is not ideal. Not sure if / how to work around.
